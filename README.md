# Booru Tag Parser
Copy current post tags and rating on various boorus and illustration2vec in to the clipboard for easy import in to a program or another booru. Also works with [boorutagparser-server](https://github.com/JetBoom/boorutagparser-server) to instantly save the full-size image on the page plus a txt file with its tags.

## How to use
When on a booru post or I2V, a button will appear in the top right to copy all image tags including the rating. You can also press the ] key. The tags will go directly in to your clipboard. This is great for importing the tags in to a tagging program like Hydrus Network or another booru.

You can also use [boorutagparser-server](https://github.com/JetBoom/boorutagparser-server) which will save the full-size image on the current page to your disk along with a .txt file with all the tags. *This allows you to drag the entire folder in to Hydrus, importing all the files and tags along with them all at once.*
